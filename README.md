# EEG_Classification
classification of processed and filtered EEG signals based on 10-20 montage electrode placement 
dataset acquired from the third BCI competion (binary motor imagery dataset)

File decription:

CNN-Rev1: Deep learning model to be trained of filter banks of process EEG data

CSP_functions: set of functions (e.g. composite covariance calculation) for use in Common Spatial Patters

MRI_vis: Basic function to visualize MRI slices

cwtScalogram: simple funtion to plot the color maped CWT transformation 

filterDesign: set of Digital filters to be used in processing

study wavelet: simple tool to analyse the perfoermence of wavelet denosing compared to raw signal
